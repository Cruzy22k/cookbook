# Lecture: Core Concepts of Reading Files in Bash (Easy + IFS splitting)

## 1. Checking if a file exists

Before you read a file, make sure it‚Äôs really there.

* Command: `[ -f filename ]`
* If it‚Äôs true, the file exists and is a regular file.
* If not, you avoid errors by handling the missing file.
  This is like checking if your homework is in your bag before trying to hand it in.

## 2. Using a `for` loop

You can loop over file contents with a `for` loop.

* Example: `for word in $(cat file); do ... done`
* Problem: it splits on spaces and newlines, so `Mary Jane` becomes two pieces: `Mary` and `Jane`.
  Good for simple lists without spaces, but weak when data is messy.

## 3. Using a `while` loop

A `while` loop is the safe way to read files line by line.

* Example:

  ```bash
  while IFS= read -r line; do
      echo "$line"
  done < file.txt
  ```
* Keeps each line whole, including spaces.
* Stops at the end of the file automatically.
  This is the professional way to process real files.

## 4. IFS splitting (bonus advanced concept)

IFS = Internal Field Separator. It tells Bash what counts as a ‚Äúdivider‚Äù when splitting text.

* Default: spaces, tabs, newlines.
* You can change it, for example:

  ```bash
  IFS=, read -r name score
  ```

  Splits `Alice,95` into `name=Alice` and `score=95`.
  This is useful for CSV files or structured data.

# Why this matters

* Scripts without file checks crash.
* `for` loops are simple but fragile.
* `while` loops are reliable and handle spaces.
* IFS gives you control over how lines are split, which makes Bash powerful for text processing.
