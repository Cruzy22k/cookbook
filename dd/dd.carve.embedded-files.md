# Problem: Extracting an embedded file from a larger binary blob

Sometimes a valid file is hidden or embedded inside a larger binary container. For example, a raw dump may contain a header or unrelated data before the actual file begins.
The task is to locate the starting offset of the embedded file and carve it out into its own standalone file so it can be opened normally.

---

## Solution

```bash
# Use dd to carve out the embedded file
dd if=input_blob.bin of=output_file.ext bs=1 skip=OFFSET
```

* `if=input_blob.bin` → the binary blob that contains extra data at the start.
* `of=output_file.ext` → the carved file to be created (e.g., `.zip`, `.png`, `.7z`, etc.).
* `bs=1` → set block size to 1 byte, so the skip value is interpreted as bytes.
* `skip=OFFSET` → number of bytes to skip before the embedded file starts (replace `OFFSET` with the actual value, e.g. 1024).

Once carved, the output file can be opened with the appropriate tool for its format.

### Technical details

* By default, `dd` uses a block size of 512 bytes, which makes `skip=N` mean “skip N×512 bytes.”
* If the embedded file starts at a **byte-level offset**, always set `bs=1` so that `skip=N` is interpreted in **bytes**.
* Everything after the offset is copied into the output file.

## Discussion

* **Deeper discussion:**
  This technique is called **file carving** — extracting a file from within another binary by cutting off the leading bytes. It is widely used in digital forensics, CTFs, and reverse engineering.

* **Where else is this tool used?**

  * Carving images, archives, or executables from raw disk dumps.
  * Extracting firmware components from embedded device binaries.
  * Recovering intact data from corrupted or partially overwritten files.

* **Why should students care?**

  * It illustrates how files are recognized by **headers (magic numbers)** and can be separated by offsets.
  * It provides practice with `dd`, a powerful Unix tool for low-level data manipulation.
  * It strengthens understanding of how binary data is structured, which is essential in security, forensics, and systems programming.
