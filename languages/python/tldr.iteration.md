# Iteration 

Iteration is a fundamental concept in programming that refers to repeating a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. It's like running laps; you keep going around the track until you've completed the number of laps you set out to do. In programming, we use iteration to perform tasks over and over, such as processing items in a list, calculating sums, or even generating a sequence of numbers.

Key Concepts:

* Loop: The cycle of repeating tasks.
* Iterator: Your current position in the cycle, often represented by a variable.
* Condition: The rule that decides when to stop the loop. If the condition is true, keep going; if false, stop.

Types of Loops:

* For Loop: Think of it as stating the exact number of laps you want to run from the start. You know the beginning and the end.

* While Loop: This is more like running laps until you feel tired. You keep going as long as a certain condition (like still having energy) is true.
