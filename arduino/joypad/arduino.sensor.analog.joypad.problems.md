## Problems

- You want the Arduino to notice when the joystick’s push button is tapped, and show a message only once per press.  
- You need to display both the horizontal and vertical positions of the joystick as numbers that change smoothly from minimum to maximum.  
- Your project should react only when the joystick is pushed strongly to the left side. If it’s not pushed left, the Arduino should stay quiet.  
- In a simple game, the Arduino should say “LEFT” when the joystick is pushed left, and “RIGHT” when it’s pushed right. It should always print one or the other.  
- You want to tell whether the joystick is pointing up, down, left, right, or sitting in the middle, and print that result.  
- You’d like to turn the joystick’s raw numbers (0–1023) into a friendlier scale, like 0–100%.  
- You want two LEDs: one lights up if the joystick is pushed left, the other lights if it’s pushed right. If the joystick is centered, both LEDs should stay off.  
- You’d like to make a buzzer louder or softer depending on how far you push the joystick up or down.
