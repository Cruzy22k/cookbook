# problem: How do I read the joystick‚Äôs X and Y positions with analogRead?

`arduino.sensors.analog.joypad.xy-read`

The joystick has two knobs inside (potentiometers). One measures **left/right** (X axis), the other measures **up/down** (Y axis). Each knob sends a number between **0 and 1023** depending on where the stick is pushed. In the middle, the number is close to **512**. We want to read both numbers and print them so we can see how the joystick moves.

## Solution

```cpp
// Joystick axes are connected to analog pins
const int JOY_X = A0;
const int JOY_Y = A1;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // start serial monitor
}

void loop() {
  // read the joystick
  int xValue = analogRead(JOY_X);  // 0..1023
  int yValue = analogRead(JOY_Y);  // 0..1023

  // show values on the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("X: ");
  Serial.print(xValue);
  Serial.print("   Y: ");
  Serial.println(yValue);

  delay(100); // small pause so it‚Äôs easy to read
}
```

**Technical discussion (how/why)**

* `analogRead(pin)` asks Arduino to measure the voltage on that pin and turn it into a number (0 = 0 V, 1023 = 5 V).
* The joystick‚Äôs middle point is close to **512**, so values smaller than that mean ‚Äúleft‚Äù or ‚Äúup,‚Äù and values bigger mean ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúdown.‚Äù
* `Serial.print` sends the numbers to your computer so you can see them in the Serial Monitor.
* The `delay(100)` slows things down so the numbers don‚Äôt scroll too fast.

## Discussion

* **Why should students care?** This is how Arduino can ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to sensors. Once you can read numbers from the joystick, you can control lights, motors, buzzers, or even games.
* **Where else used?** Sliders, dials, light sensors, or any sensor that gives a changing voltage.

## Challenge

1. Print the joystick values **only when they change** (don‚Äôt print if they stay the same).
2. Print `"CENTER"` when both X and Y are close to 512, and print `"MOVING"` otherwise.
