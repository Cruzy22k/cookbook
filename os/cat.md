cat "$(ls -Q | grep filename)"
```

## 5. **Displaying Line Numbers**
### ðŸ”¹ Show line numbers while displaying a file
```sh
cat -n filename.txt
```

---

## 6. **Concatenating Multiple Files**
### ðŸ”¹ Combine multiple files into one
```sh

```

### ðŸ”¹ Append file contents to another file
```sh
